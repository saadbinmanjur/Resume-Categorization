# Text Preprocessing Method


*1. Importing Necessary Libraries:*

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import string
```

- `stopwords` contains a list of common words that are often removed from text as they don't contribute much to the meaning.
- `word_tokenize` is used for tokenizing the text into individual words.
- `WordNetLemmatizer` is used to perform lemmatization, which reduces words to their base or root form.
- `string` provides a collection of punctuation characters.

*2. Defining the `clean_text` Function:*

```python
def clean_text(series):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    cleaned_texts = []

    for text in series:
        # Tokenization
        tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
        # Removing punctuation and numeric values
        no_punct_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in string.punctuation and not token.isnumeric()]
        # Removing stop words
        no_stopwords_tokens = [token for token in no_punct_tokens if token not in stop_words]
        # Lemmatization
        lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in no_stopwords_tokens]
        # Join tokens back into a string
        cleaned_text = ' '.join(lemmatized_tokens)
        cleaned_texts.append(cleaned_text)

    return cleaned_texts
```

*3. Text Preprocessing Steps:*

- *Tokenization:*
  - The `word_tokenize` function is used to split the text into individual words (tokens).
  - `.lower()` is used to convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistent processing.

- *Removing Punctuation and Numeric Values:*
  - `string.punctuation` contains a list of punctuation characters.
  - `not token.isnumeric()` ensures that numeric values are excluded.

- *Removing Stop Words:*
  - `stopwords.words('english')` provides a set of common English stop words.
  - Stop words are words like "and", "the", "is", etc. that often don't contribute much to the meaning of the text.

- *Lemmatization:*
  - Lemmatization reduces words to their base or root form. For example, "running" becomes "run", "better" becomes "good", etc.
  - This step helps in standardizing words and reducing inflected forms to their core meaning.

- *Joining Tokens Back into a String:*
  - The final lemmatized tokens are joined back into a string format to create the cleaned text for each document.

*4. Usage:*

You can use the `clean_text` function to preprocess a series of text data, such as the content of resumes in your dataset. For example:

```python
# Assuming you have a pandas Series containing resume content
cleaned_resumes = clean_text(resumes_series)
```

*Conclusion:*

Text preprocessing is essential to ensure that the text data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. The `clean_text` function combines tokenization, punctuation removal, stop word removal, and lemmatization to create cleaned and standardized text that can be fed into a machine learning model for further analysis, such as resume categorization.
